The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations in CSS. However, there's a common error related to spaces in `calc()` expressions.  If you forget spaces around the operators (+, -, *, /), it can lead to unexpected results or parsing errors. For example, `width:calc(100%-10px)` is wrong; correct is `width:calc(100% - 10px)`. Another error could be mixing units inconsistently. For example, using both pixels and percentages directly without proper conversion can lead to unpredictable behaviour.
